# Product Expiration Tracker

A small React + TypeScript app bootstrapped with Vite for tracking product expiration dates.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: Node.js 18+.

Install deps
```bash
npm install
```

Run dev server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production
```bash
npm run build
```

Preview production build
```bash
npm run preview
```

Run linting (if configured)
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Notes

- This project uses Vite with React + TypeScript. The default template supports HMR and basic ESLint rules.
- If you want stricter ESLint checks (type-aware rules), enable the type-checked ESLint configs and point parserOptions.project to your tsconfig(s).
- The experimental React Compiler can improve runtime performance but may affect dev/build times. See https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation for details.

## Where to edit

- Source: src/
- Configs: vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, eslint.config.js (or .eslintrc)

Feel free to simplify or expand this README based on project needs.
